My song is love

Love to the lovely song

And it goes on

You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart

Is made of stone

And it's so hard to see you clearly

You don't have to be on your own

You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back

And I'm not gonna say I don't know now

You're a target that I'm aiming at

Take my message home

My song is love

My song is love, unknown

But I'm on fire for you, clearly

You don't have to be on your own

You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back

Oh I'm not gonna say I don't know now

You're a target that I'm aiming at

And I'm nothing on my own

Got to get that message home

And I'm not gonna stand and wait

Not gonna be there until it's much too late

On a platform I'm gonna stand and say

That I'm nothing on my own

And I love you, please come home

And my song is love, is love unknown

And I've got to get that message home

Moi quand j'étais un adolescent
